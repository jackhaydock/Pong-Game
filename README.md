# Pong

## Summary
This is a clone of the 1972 game, 'Pong'. If you've lived under a rock for 45 years it's basically a simplified version of tennis. Your objective is to get the ball past your opponent and off the screen as many times as possible.


## Controls

|    | Left Player | Right Player|
|----|-------------|-------------|
| Up | W | Up Arrow |
| Down | S | Down Arrow |
| Pause | Esc | Esc |
| Reset | R | R |

You can also use the mouse with the menu in the top right to Pause, Reset, Mute and Quit. Be aware there is no 'Are you sure?' warnings for Reset or Quit just yet.


## Notes:
* Exporting audio into a WebGL build requires a whole different process so that will come later, for now if you want audio (I recommend it, there's a great royalty-free track by Kevin MacLeod) you'll have to download one of the Linux/Windows Builds.
* Once I am happy that this game is complete and tidy, I intend to create a more original version of Pong with extra gamemodes and new features absent from the original Pong.


## Planned updates:
* More Audio options (eg. Pause/Play, Multiple tracks, mute music/sfx separately)
* Adjustable resolution for HTML
* Adjustable resolution without restart
* Improve Menu interface
* Improved visuals
* Audio for WebGL
* Fix bug where ball occasionally flies offscreen at high speed
* Add singleplayer mode against AI player
